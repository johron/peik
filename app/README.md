# Peik App

## TODO:
- Implement a way to put userdata and other saved data in memory so i can read it without asynchronous calls, prevent lots of loading spinners :)
- Mp3 metadata ripper to autofill song import fields, ffmpeg, and converting to flac so everything is same format
  - https://pub.dev/packages/ffmpeg_kit_flutter_new and then just cmd line ffmpeg commands for windows and linux
- Make it so updating data field schemas doesn't delete existing data
- A panel for popups with progress bars for actions like downloading, importing, etc.
- Remote sync to go server
- Backups, configurable, app will not touch backup made by a different version
